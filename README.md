This repository contains the application files and scripts to process a pair of Envisat ASAR data with [ROI_PAC](http://www.openchannelfoundation.org/projects/ROI_PAC) (Repeat Orbit Interferometry PACkage), a software package jointly created by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory division of NASA and CalTech for processing SAR data to create InSAR (Interferometric synthetic aperture radar) images, or 'interferograms'. This geodetic method uses two or more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes to generate maps of surface deformation or digital elevation models, using differences in the phase of the waves returning to the radar sensor. The technique can potentially measure centimetre-scale changes in deformation over spans of days to years. It has applications for geophysical monitoring of natural hazards, for example earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and in structural engineering, in particular monitoring of subsidence and structural stability.

### Getting Started 

To run this application you will need a Developer Cloud Sandbox, that can be either requested from the ESA [Research & Service Support Portal](http://eogrid.esrin.esa.int/cloudtoolbox/) for ESA G-POD related projects and ESA registered user accounts, or directly from [Terradue's Portal](http://www.terradue.com/partners), provided user registration approval. 

A Developer Cloud Sandbox provides Earth Sciences data access services, and helper tools for a user to implement, test and validate a scalable data processing application. It offers a dedicated virtual machine and a Cloud Computing environment.
The virtual machine runs in two different lifecycle modes: Sandbox mode and Cluster mode. 
Used in Sandbox mode (single virtual machine), it supports cluster simulation and provides user assistance functions in building the distributed application.
Used in Cluster mode (a set of master and slaves nodes), it supports the deployment and execution of the application with the power of distributed computing for data processing over large datasets (leveraging the Hadoop Streaming MapReduce technology). 

### Installation 

Log on your Developer Cloud Sandbox host.

Install ROI_PAC using the 'yum' command. ROI-PAC is a software package available through Terradue's Cloud Platform software repository.

> ROI_PAC is a copyrighted software that requires a license. Licenses are available at no charge for non-commercial use from the [Open Channel Foundation](http://www.openchannelfoundation.org/projects/ROI_PAC). Read the [license terms](http://www.openchannelfoundation.org/project/print_license.php?group_id=282&license_id=61).

```
sudo yum install roi_pac.x86_64 roi_pac-grdfile.x86_64 
```

Run these commands in a shell:

```bash
cd
git clone git@github.com:Terradue/InSAR-ROI_PAC.git
cd InSAR-ROI_PAC
mvn install
```

### Submitting the processing request

Invoke the ROI_PAC processing via the Cloud Sandbox's embedded OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) interface, using either:

* the WPS client in your Cloud Sandbox's [dashboard](http://docs.terradue.com/developer-sandbox/start/discover.html#user-dashboard-web-ui)
* your Browser, with a GET request to the WPS access point
* a POST request to the WPS access point
